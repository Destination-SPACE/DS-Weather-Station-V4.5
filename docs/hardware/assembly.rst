Destination Weather Station v4.5 Assembly
=========================================

The Destination Weather Station v4.5 is preassembled with the majority of the circuit components.

Before using the weather station, you will need to :ref:`solder<soldering>` the :ref:`XIAO RP2040 microcontroller<_xiao-RP2040>`, :ref:`OLED display<oled-display>`, and :ref:`power switch<power-switch>`. Follow the instructions below to solder your weather station. You can then :ref:`connect the batteries<batteries>` and insert the microSD card.

Soldering
---------
.. _soldering:

To solder the weather station, follow the instructions below. Tools required to complete these steps are:
- Soldering iron
- Solder wire

XIAO RP2040
~~~~~~~~~~~
.. _xiao-RP2040:

To solder the XIAO RP2040 to the weather station, begin by inserting the long side of the 1x7 header pins into the weather station board as shown below.

OLED Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. _oled-display:

To solder the OLED display to the weather station, you will follow similar procedures to the steps above to solder the XIAO.

Begin by inserting the long side of the 1x4 header into the weather station board as shown below.
